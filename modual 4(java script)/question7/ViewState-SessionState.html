    It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.

    Information is stored on the client’s end only.

    used to allow the persistence of page-instance-specific data.

    ViewState values are lost/cleared when new page is loaded






    *SessionState*



    Maintained at session level.

    Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.

    In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration.

    Information is stored on the server.

    used for the persistence of user-specific data on the server’s end.

    SessionState can be cleared by programmer or user or in case of timeouts.
