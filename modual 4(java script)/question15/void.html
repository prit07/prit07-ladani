    We can use JavaScript void 0 to prevent reloading of a page. 
    Letâ€™s understand this with the two examples given below.
     The first example does not use JavaScript:void(0), but the second uses it to prevent reloading. 
     We will also use the ondblclick event handler so that nothing happens on a single click and 
     the action is handled on double click.
